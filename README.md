# About the Project

<p align="justify">
The Mask Detection System is an AI-driven solution designed to ensure the proper use of face masks, which became essential during the pandemic to prevent coronavirus transmission. 
This system automatically detects whether a person is wearing a mask correctly, minimizing the need for human intervention in enforcing mask policies.
Proper mask usage is critical, and failure to wear a mask properly renders it ineffective.
Without manual intervention, an automated solution like the Mask Detection System can play a vital role in enforcing mask compliance. 
This project can be considered relevant in present day scenario as well, because almost all airborne diseases can be prevented from spreading rapidly by the effective use of a simple facemask.
